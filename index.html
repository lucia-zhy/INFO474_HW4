          <p>
            Context: By the sketch I drew, it's an ambient color clock used under the study setting. This clock visualizes
            the color of every time period during a day, it could help students understand and notice
            how long they have studied by seeing the color first.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> It's used in study setting.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> I made the ambient color choices as the background color
              can be changed along with different periods of time. I set the color to change every hour,
              in the night with darker color, then moves to midnight and early morning changes to lighter color,
              while in the noon and afternoon changes to warmer color.
              I choose the digital clock font style as my time, because I think it can show the modern style,
              and give the sense of digital time.
              It can be used under any circumstance with any device.
              </li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> 1. Could add the dynamic effects: adding the flowing effects,
            or sunlight reflecting effects, to make it become much more vivid and beautiful.
            2. Could add more interactivity, like adding the daily tasks as the purpose under the study setting.</li>

          <p>
            Context: By the sketch I drew, it's a book clock with good visualizations on visualizing the hour as chapter,
            minute as page, and second as every number appears on the book. It's suitable under the 
            study setting and clear for audience to look by finding the highlight number.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> It's used under the study setting.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> 
              1. I used the book as the clock representation because it's under the study setting,
              and it can be cleared and easy to look for students.
              2. I choose the highlight color as baby blue, because it's a calm color and can help students
              focus on their study.
              3. I set the hour as chapter, minute as page, and second as every number appears on the book,
              because it's easy to understand, also really related for students who are doing the homework
              or reading.
              There is no specific constraint, I think it can be used under every circumstance.</li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> 1. Add interaction: audience can diy the fighting words on the top-right.
            2. add the process line to show the process of time in every minute to improve the clarity
          and readablity.</li>

          <p>
            Context: By the sketch I drew, this pomodoro countdown clock visualizes the countdown path while students
            using this clock to help them focus and study. Also students can interact with the clock by clicking several buttons.
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Context:</strong> It's under the study setting and in a pomodoro mode for students want to
            use the clock to focus in a period-focus study mode.</li>
            <li><strong>Design decisions:</strong> 1. I choose the green color as my main showing color
              because I take reference to the forest app; when I want to focus, green color is always considered
              as the refreshing color that can help people focus. Besides, I use tree and burgeoning emojis on my clock to fit the vibe.
              2. Design as a circle; along with the time passes, it'll show the processing path to illustrate
              how long you've studied and how long is left.
              3. Interaction! I added the start, reset, and pause button to help audience control the clock, increase
            the interactivity.</li>
            <li><strong>Future work:</strong> 1. Add tasks that audience want to do as the plan list, to increase
            the interactivity. 2. Add the rest time, around 5 minutes, after every pomodoro cycle.
          3. Users can modify the pomodoro countdown time. </li>
